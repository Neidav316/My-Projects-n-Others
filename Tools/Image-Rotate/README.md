# Image Rotate

In this program, the user can load images into the website, choose an image, choose the amount of degrees and rotate the image by the chosen amount, if it will be left or right

## Note: 
The rotation method uses openCV, in which creates new Mat that gives the outputs of the rotation on the same canvas, but this method makes the output lose quality due to interpolation, therefor, when rotating the same image multiple times, the image gets more blurry.
