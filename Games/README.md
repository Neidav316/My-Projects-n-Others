## First Godot Game

It is a 2D side scroller game, originally created by GDQuest and showed a tutorial for making this game, using the GDScript language.
I also added a few animations for the portal and enemy death.

It is a regular snake game, origianlly created by Bro Code that showed a simple tutorial for a snake game in Python, in which I added a menu and another way to play snake that involves 2 users to play 1v1 game in which they will try to block each other.
